# SRv6_INT_P4

This repository implements programmable network telemetry and routing pipelines using **P4**, focusing on:
- **SRv6 (Segment Routing over IPv6)** for flexible source-based routing.
- **INT (In-band Network Telemetry)** for real-time performance measurement.
- Comparative evaluation against traditional software-based routing approaches.

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`srv6int/`](./srv6int) | SRv6 + INT implementation and Mininet simulation |
| [`ipv4netflow/`](./ipv4netflow) | IPv4-based NetFlow measurement for baseline comparison |
| [`snmp/`](./snmp) | SNMP-based telemetry module for comparison |

Each folder includes its own `README.md` detailing setup, scripts, and results.
